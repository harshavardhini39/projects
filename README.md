To create a Rock Paper Scissors game using both Python and web technologies, you can build a web application that allows users to play the game in a browser interface. Here's a description of how you can combine Python and web technologies to implement the game: This project is an interactive game implemented using Python and Tkinter. The objective was to create a fun and engaging game where the user can play against the computer.

To begin with, I used Python as the programming language and Tkinter as the GUI framework. Tkinter provided a convenient and easy-to-use interface for designing the graphical user interface. The project also utilized the PIL (Python Imaging Library) library for handling and rendering the game images.

The GUI design is simple yet intuitive. I organized the main window, labels, buttons, and images using Tkinter's grid-based organization. The user interface has a visually appealing layout that allows users to easily interact with the game.

For image handling, I employed the PIL library to load and display images in Tkinter. Specifically, I used images for the rock, paper, and scissor choices for both the user and the computer. These images are dynamically updated based on the choices made by the user and the computer during the game.

Moving on to the game logic, I implemented the rules of the Rock-Scissor-Paper game. When the user selects their choice through the buttons, the computer's choice is generated randomly. The checkWin() function compares the choices made by the user and the computer to determine the winner. Scores are tracked for both the user and the computer using label widgets, which are updated in real-time based on the game outcomes.

One of the key aspects of this project is the user interaction. Users can select their choice (rock, paper, or scissor) by clicking on the respective buttons. The game logic is then triggered, and the outcome is displayed in a message label. This provides immediate feedback to the user and updates dynamically as the game progresses.

 The frontend provides a user-friendly interface. This allows users to access and enjoy the game .
